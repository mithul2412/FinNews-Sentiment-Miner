# FinNews Sentiment Miner

## Description
FinNews Sentiment Miner is a system designed to perform stock market sentiment analysis by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and web mining techniques. It collects financial news data through web scraping APIs like Finnhub, Marketaux, NewsAPI, then uses NLTK-based sentiment analysis and named entity recognition to transform the raw text into actionable insights. By integrating these sentiment metrics into trading strategies, the system can potentially inform more profitable decisions. Currently, the project is undergoing development to incorporate a transformer-based architecture for question-answering functionality, aiming to enhance the depth and speed of insights extracted from financial news.
